// Lift the `people` state up so that

// 1. it still gets updated by the `Counter` component and
// 2. the actual people count is dynamically displayed in the `App` component.

// You can use the following hints as guideline:

// - Move the `people` state to the `App` component.
// - In the `App` component, you want to have two helper functions to `handle` adding and subtracting a person from the `people` state.
// - Pass your `handle` functions to the `Counter` component:
//   - use one prop for each of them;
//   - the prop should have the same name as the `handle` function, but should start with `on` instead of `handle` (Hint: `onDelete={handleDelete}`).
// - In the `Counter` component
//   - receive the two newly created props and
//   - pass them to the correct button's `onClick` prop. You do **not** need to use an anonymous function here. Instead of writing `onClick={() => onSomeEvent()}` you can pass the function directly like this `onClick={onSomeEvent}`.
